# HandWritingClassificationModel
A deep learning project for classifying handwritten names using PyTorch and computer vision techniques.

## Project Overview
This project implements an advanced handwriting recognition system that can classify handwritten names from images. The model uses state-of-the-art CNN architectures with data augmentation and preprocessing techniques to achieve high accuracy on handwriting classification tasks.

## Features
EfficientNet-B0 based CNN for large vocabularies
Spatial Attention Network for smaller vocabularies
